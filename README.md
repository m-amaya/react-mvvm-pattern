# React MVVM Pattern

This app simulates a simple chatbot interface utilizing the MVVM pattern in
React. To accomplish this, the project is structured as follows:

```sh
src/
├── components/         # Pure UI components (View)
├── models/             # Domain-wide state and business logic (Model)
├── viewModels/         # Localized state and business logic (ViewModel)
└── views/              # Components connecting the ViewModel to the View
```
